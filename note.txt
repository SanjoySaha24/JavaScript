The error message you're encountering indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is preventing scripts from running on your system. PowerShell's default security settings prevent the execution of scripts for security reasons.

To resolve this issue and allow ts-node (or any other PowerShell script) to run, you can adjust the execution policy. Here's how you can do it:

Changing PowerShell Execution Policy
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Right-click on the PowerShell icon and select "Run as administrator". This is important because changing execution policies requires administrative privileges.
Check Current Execution Policy:

To check the current execution policy, run the following command:
powershell
Copy code
Get-ExecutionPolicy
This will return the current execution policy. The default policy is usually Restricted.
Change Execution Policy:

To change the execution policy to allow script execution, use the following command:
powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
This command allows the execution of local scripts (those created on your computer) that are signed by a trusted publisher. You can also use Bypass as an option if you want to allow all scripts to run without a digital signature, though this is less secure.
Confirm Change:

After running the command, confirm the change by typing Y (yes) and pressing Enter.
Run ts-node Command Again:

After changing the execution policy, try running your ts-node command again:
bash
Copy code
ts-node "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\JavaScript\TypeScript\var.ts"
This should now execute without the previous security error.
Important Notes:
Security Implications: Changing the execution policy to RemoteSigned or Bypass lowers the security of your system because it allows scripts to run without validation. Only do this if you trust the scripts you are running and understand the risks.

Resetting Execution Policy: After running your script, you might want to reset the execution policy to its previous setting for security reasons:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
Administrator Privileges: Ensure that you have administrative rights when changing the execution policy.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the PowerShell security error and run ts-node or other PowerShell scripts on your system.
